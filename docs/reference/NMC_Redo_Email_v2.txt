Subject: 15‑minute redo — Balanced evaluation plan + quick‑win pilots

Sarah (cc Dan),

May I request 15 minutes to show Michael a balanced plan that starts with his question: “How do you decide where AI should go?”

I’ll walk through a short evaluation method (measure unit economics → score opportunities with RICE → pilot with numeric gates), a KPI catalog with definitions (no vague promises; baselines first), and two quick‑win pilots we can validate in 30–45 days. The approach is model‑agnostic and aligns to your ChatGPT Enterprise rollout—no rip‑and‑replace on Day 1.

Attached:
• One‑pager: Operational AI Audit & Activation (balanced plan)
• KPI catalog (definitions + measurement)
• Opportunity scoring template (CSV)

If helpful, I can keep it to the 90‑second video + 5‑bullet talk track and book 15 minutes for Q&A.

Thank you,
David
